# Robot Arm

**ToDo: Pick a better name**

This is a project to help me understand how robotics work.

There will be many flaws in the design, but I hope to improve those along the way.

## Why this project?

There are a few reasons why I'm doing this:

1. The [servo arm kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09TWRWGRL/) I bought to use to learn originally has a huge number of flaws and is basically useless when it comes to repeatability due to issues with servo control and the momentum caused but the weight of the arm moving around
2. I already have various stepper motors and control boards kicking around on my workstation, and I want to reuse them to save money
3. I couldn't tell which of the designs on [Printables](https://www.printables.com) were up to date and supported, so I decided to add to the confusion with my own design
4. I wanted this to be as basic as possible, so I can understand both the mechanics and the code behind basic movement before I move on to more complicated designs

## What will it be capable of?

Eventually, I want the arm to be capable of moving across at least 5 degrees of freedom and change the end-effector (claw etc) by itself. 

There is a long way to go before I get there...

## What can it do now?

Nothing.  As of this writing (01st May 2024), all that is available are the 3D printable parts.

I hope to add some code based on ROS2 in the coming weeks and months.
